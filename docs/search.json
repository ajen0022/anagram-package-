Normalizes character cases removes non-alphabetic characters consistent comparison. Detects anagrams comparing character counts word. Offers option analyze subsets words anagram relationships. Output: function returns TRUE words input vector anagrams , FALSE otherwise. subset analysis, function provides insight whether combination words within subset forms anagrams. 2.Anagram Subset Analysis anagramsubset_function designed check whether subset words contains anagrams , considering combinations characters specified minimum length. achieves generating combinations characters specified length word comparing combinations identify anagrams within subset. Features: function first defines three internal helper functions: count_chars: Counts occurrences character word. are_anagrams: Determines whether two words anagrams comparing character counts. generate_combinations: Generates possible combinations characters specified length word. Example 1, subset contains words (“right” “tight”) anagrams , considering combinations characters least length 4. Therefore, function returns TRUE. Example 2, subset contain pairs words anagrams , considering combinations characters least length 3. Therefore, function returns FALSE. 3.
